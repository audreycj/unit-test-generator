// This file will define the syntax for generating test code based on the selected testing framework.
// It will have methods for generating test cases and any necessary setup or teardown code.
// For example, if the user has selected JUnit 5 as the testing framework, the TestCode class will generate test code in the syntax of JUnit 5.
// This class may also handle any framework-specific nuances or features that are required to generate valid test code.
